# [Turing Capital](http://www.turing.capital/)

[Turing Capital](http://www.turing.capital/) is the crypto "paypal mafia". We are structured as a DAO and a collective of founders, ethereum core developers, engineers, inventors, and investors. We partner and support projects at all stages from pre-whitepaper to public ICOs.            
             
With the large number of ICOs currently around, Turing operates as an investing syndicate that shares the burden of bringing transparency in the field. We plan to use GitHub to organize our due diligence efforts to help our members gain the confidence they need before deciding which tokens to buy.
